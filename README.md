# Chemistry-icons
<p align="justify">This repository contains a small set of handmade SVG/png icons for chemistry/biology. These icons can be used freely in any scientific production, including papers, presentations and reports. This repository has been created to meet chemists' needs in the design of their figures/schemes by avoiding the use of websites which may include subscription fees or citing sources.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, four icons are available related to laboratory equipment. This repository will be updated gradually.</p>
